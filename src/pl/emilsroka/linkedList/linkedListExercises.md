# Set of exercises about linked list

## Exercise 1
Create a dynamic singly linked list class.  
Class have to contain the following methods:
- addFirst - add new node with given value as head
- addLast - add new node with given value as tail
- add - add node with given value at given index
- deleteFirst - delete head
- deleteLast - delete tail
- delete - delete node at given index

## Exercise 2
Implement below methods:
- size - returns number of nodes in linked list 
- contains - returns boolean that indicates if given value is in list
- indexOf - returns index of node with given value (if exist)
- toArray - returns array that contains values from nodes

## Exercise 3
Implement method that reverses linked list in place. Time complexity should be O(n)

## Exercise 4 
Implement a two new methods in list class:
- get - returns n'th value from the start of list.
- getFromTheEnd - returns n'th value from the end.

Don't use variable that stores size of array to stop iteration. You can index from 0 or 1. Time complexity should be O(n)
