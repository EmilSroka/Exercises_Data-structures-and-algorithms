# Set of exercises about stack

## Exercise 1
Create class `StringReverse` that contains a single static method `reverse`. The method should reverse a string by using a stack.

## Exercise 2
Create class `StringChecker` that implements a single static method `isBalanced`. The method should check if a string is balanced. [More info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-balanced-parentheses-in-an-expression/).

## Exercise 3  
Implement a stack using an array. `ArrayStack` class should have these methods:
- `push` - add an element to a stack. Returns number of elements in the stack
- `pop` - returns a top element from the stack and removes it
- `peek` - returns a top element from the stack
- `empty` - returns boolean that indicates if the stack is empty
- `full` - returns boolean that indicates if the stack is full

## Exercise 4
Implement two stacks in one array. Support these operations:  
`push1`, `push2`, `pop1`, `pop2`, `empty1`, `empty2`, `full`  
Make sure your implementation is space efficient.

## Exercise 5
Design a `MinStack` that supports `push`, `pop` and `min` that retrieving the minimum value in constant time.

## Exercise 6  
Implement a stack using a linked list. `LinkedListStack` class should have these methods:
- `push` - add an element to a stack. Returns itself
- `pop` - returns a top element from the stack and removes it
- `peek` - returns a top element from the stack
- `empty` - returns boolean that indicates if the stack is empty
